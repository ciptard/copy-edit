# Welcome to copy-editor

I’ve been suffering from writer’s block for some time. It is probably
because I don’t have much to say anymore, but it does give me a good
excuse to write this application.

copy-editor is an application that helps you *write*. I’m not sure yet
the direction this will go, or even if I’ll finish it, but it’s bound to
be an interesting ride. 

For now, I want the application to: 

 - Provide a place to store my draft posts.
 - Allow me to nominate ‘editors’ for each post, and let these editors
   take a peek at my writing, and hopefully give me their
   thoughts/suggestions/etc. 

Some thoughts for the future: 

 - Keep track of post revisions.
 - Integrate with my blog, and do a one-click publish.
 - Use those cool ‘line comments’ similar to the [Django Book][1].
